    <p class="govuk-body-l">You can use this service to request a test for patients who need to visit a hospital for elective care.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to request a test for your patients</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You should request tests for your patients <strong>no sooner than 5 days</strong> before their appointment date, and <strong>no later than X days</strong> before their appointment date. This is so there is enough time for their test to be delivered and completed.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Check what you need</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You will need the following patient details to request a test:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Date of birth</li>
      <li>Mobile phone number</li>
      <li>NHS number</li>
      <li>Shipping address</li>
      <li>Date of procedure</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you do not have all of these details, or if the patient will not be capable of taking a home test, youâ€™ll need to arrange for the patient to be tested a different way, such as x, y , or z. You can <a href="#">find out what taking a home test involves.</a></p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Receiving test results</h2>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>patient test results will be sent to <strong>email@gmail.com</strong></li>
      <li>the patient will also receive an SMS with their results</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use the patient data</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">To find out how we use your personal data when you register for a coronavirus test, <a href="#">read the coronavirus privacy note.</a></p>
