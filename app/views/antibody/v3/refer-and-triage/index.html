        You can sign up for a free coronavirus (COVID-19) antibody test to find out if you’ve had the virus before. 
        There is <a href = "/antibody/v3/govuk/testing-for-coronavirus">a different test to check if you currently have the virus (sometimes called a “swab test”).</a>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can do the antibody test even if you think you’ve not had the virus before.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the test</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">It is a ‘fingerprick’ blood test. It is posted to you and comes with everything you need to take the test and post your sample to get your results</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The test checks for coronavirus antibodies. If you have them, it’s likely you’ve had the virus before.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        Having coronavirus antibodies does not mean you are guaranteed to be immune (protected) from further infection. You might get the virus again or spread it.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long it takes to sign up</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">It should take 5 to 10 minutes to sign up.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">After you’ve signed up</h2>
      <p class = "govuk-body">You need to wait for a message inviting you to order a test. It’s sent within a few days by email or text. But it can take up to 3 months because test kits are limited and need to be prioritised.</p>
      <p class = "govuk-body">Once you get your invite message, you can order your test.</p> 
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why take the test</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">It will help the NHS and research scientists.</p>
