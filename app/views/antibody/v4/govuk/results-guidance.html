    <p class = "govuk-body">If you’ve had a coronavirus (COVID-19) antibody test there are 3 types of result you can get:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>positive</li>
        <li>negative</li>
        <li>void</li>
    </ul>
    <p class = "govuk-body">
        You should get your result within 3 to 7 days of taking the test (usually by text message). 
        If you do not get your result, call the coronavirus testing contact centre. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Types of antibody test result</h2>

    <h2 class = "govuk-heading-m">Positive antibody test result</h2>
    <p class = "govuk-body">A positive result means the test did find COVID-19 coronavirus antibodies so it is likely you’ve had the virus before. It is not possible to say when.</p>
    <p class = "govuk-body">It does not mean you are guaranteed to be immune (protected) from further infection. You might get the virus again or spread it.</p>

    <h2 class = "govuk-heading-m">Negative antibody test result</h2>
    <p class = "govuk-body">A negative result means the test did not find COVID-19 coronavirus antibodies so it is unlikely you’ve had the virus before at the time you took the test.</p>

    <h2 class = "govuk-heading-m">Void antibody test result</h2>
    <p class = "govuk-body">A void result means the test did not work.</p> 
    <p class = "govuk-body">There are many reasons for this and it’s not possible to tell you the exact one. For example, it could be a problem with the test kit, how the test was carried out (like the blood sample collected was too small) or there was a delay between taking the sample and the lab checking it.</p>
    <p class = "govuk-body">A void result is still important for research purposes.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What an antibody test cannot tell you</h2>
    <p class = "govuk-body">An antibody test result cannot tell you:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>if you’re immune to coronavirus</li>
        <li>if you can or cannot spread the virus to other people</li>
        <li>if you have the virus at the time you take the test (a “current infection”)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class = "govuk-body">To find out if you have the virus now, there is a different test (sometimes known as a swab or virus test).</p>
    <p class = "govuk-body">An antibody test is different to the <a href = "antibody/v4/govuk/testing-for-coronavirus">swab test to check if you have coronavirus now</a>.</p>
    
    <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
        <p>Whatever your test result, you must continue to follow the same guidelines as everyone else to protect yourself and others from the virus.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">If you think your result is wrong</h2>

    <p class = "govuk-body">The test is accurate but no at-home test is 100% reliable all of the time.</p>
    <p class = "govuk-body">COVID-19 is new and more research needs to be done to understand how our bodies respond to it. For example, if antibodies are always produced and how long they last.</p>
    <p class = "govuk-body">If you know you’ve had the virus before, it’s still possible to get a negative antibody result. This can happen for some people because they do not develop antibodies, or their level of antibodies is too low for the test to detect.</p>
    <p class = "govuk-body">If you think you have not had the virus, it’s still possible to get a positive antibody result. This might happen even if you didn’t have symptoms or only very mild ones as asymptomatic COVID-19 is a known phenomenon.</p>
    <p class = "govuk-body">If you have any concerns about your test result, get advice from a health professional.</p>

    <p class = "govuk-body"><a href = "https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/">Support if you feel anxious or worried about your result</a></p>
    <p class = "govuk-body"><a href = "https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/coronavirus/coronavirus-and-your-wellbeing/#collapse058da">Coronavirus and your well-being</a></p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Protect yourself and other from the virus</h2>
    <p class = "govuk-body">Regardless of your test result you must continue to follow the same guidelines as everyone else to protect yourself and others from the virus. For example:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>wash your hands often</li>
        <li>follow social distancing advice/li>
        <li>follow any local lockdown restrictions in your area</li>
        <li>self-isolate and get tested if you (or someone you live with) get symptoms, or you are advised to by NHS Test and Trace</li>
