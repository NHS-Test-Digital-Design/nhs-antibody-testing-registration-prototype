        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7">About the antibody test kit</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The test is a ‘fingerprick’ blood test which checks for coronavirus antibodies.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The test kit is posted to you. It comes with everything you need. You take the test and post your sample back. Then you'll get your results.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
            <p class="govuk-body">This service is only for registering for an antibody test kit by post. You cannot use it to book a test at an NHS test site.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What the antibody test can tell you</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">An antibody test can tell you if it’s likely you’ve had coronavirus before.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">An antibody test does not tell you:</p>


        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>if you're protected from coronavirus</li>
          <li>if you can or cannot spread the virus to other people</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why take the test</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Taking the test helps the NHS and research scientists learn more about who’s had the virus and how it has spread.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
            <p class="govuk-body">Once you've registered, you'll get an email or text message inviting you to order a test kit. This can take a few weeks.</p>
