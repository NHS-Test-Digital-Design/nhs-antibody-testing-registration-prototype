      <p class="govuk-body">An antibody test is a blood test to check if you’ve had coronavirus (COVID-19) before. You can register for an invite to get a test kit.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The antibody test is a home test kit sent to you in the post.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
            <p class="govuk-body">It's different from the
        <a href="/antigen/v1/govuk/get-coronavirus-test">test to check if you currently have the virus.</a></p>
        </div>

 
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7">Who can register for a home test kit</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The rules for who can register for an antibody test depend on:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>where you live</li>
          <li>your job</li>
        </ul>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you're in England</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can only register for a test kit if you're 18 or over and you work in paid adult social care.</p>
      
       <p class="govuk-body">If you work in paid adult social care, you can also get an antibody test at an NHS test site. Your employer or local authority adult social care team will have more details and can help you find your nearest.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you're in Wales</h3>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">You can only register for a test if you're 18 or over and you work in paid domiciliary care (caring for people in their homes).</></p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you're in Northern Ireland</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can register for a test as part of a study to understand the spread of coronavirus.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must be 18 or over and one of these must apply:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you work in primary care (for example a GP, pharmacist, community nurse, dental nurse or optician)</li>
          <li>you do any job in a care home</li>
          <li>you’re a care worker in paid domiciliary care (caring for people in their homes)</li>
        </ul> 
        <p class="govuk-body">Not everyone in Northern Ireland who registers will get a test.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you're in Scotland</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">In Scotland, antibody testing is being used to help understand levels of previous COVID-19 infection in the population.</p>
  
        <p class="govuk-body">If you live in Scotland, you can get a test if you are:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>18 or over</li>
            <li>working in education (teaching and non-teaching staff)</li>
            <li>based in an early years education, primary, secondary or special school setting</li>
          </ul> 
          <p class="govuk-body">You may be invited to participate in testing again in the future. However, you should also be aware that signing up does not guarantee that you will receive a test, as we will be looking to select a representative sample.</p>
  
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7">About the antibody test kit</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The test is a ‘fingerprick’ blood test which checks for coronavirus antibodies.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The test kit is posted to you. It comes with everything you need. You take the test and post your sample back. Then you'll get your results.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
            <p class="govuk-body">This service is only for registering for an antibody test kit by post. You cannot use it to book a test at an NHS test site.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What the antibody test can tell you</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">An antibody test can tell you if it’s likely you’ve had coronavirus before.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">An antibody test does not tell you:</p>


        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>if you're protected from coronavirus</li>
          <li>if you can or cannot spread the virus to other people</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why take the test</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Taking the test helps the NHS and research scientists learn more about who’s had the virus and how it has spread.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Register for a test</h3>
            <p class="govuk-body">Once you've registered, you'll get an email or text message inviting you to order a test kit. This can take a few weeks.</p>
