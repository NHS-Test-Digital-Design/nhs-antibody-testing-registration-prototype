      <p class="govuk-body"><b>If the test shows you have coronavirus antibodies</b></p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
      <p>Even if you have coronavirus antibodies, you might not be immune (protected) from catching the virus again or spreading it. </p>
