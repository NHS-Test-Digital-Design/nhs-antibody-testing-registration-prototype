      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the test</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The test checks for coronavirus antibodies. If you have them, it’s likely you’ve had the virus before.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">It is a ‘fingerprick’ blood test. It is posted to you and comes with everything you need to 
        take the test and post your sample to get your results</p>
        
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      Even if you have coronavirus antibodies, you might not be immune from catching the virus again or spreading it.
      </div>
       

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long it takes to sign up</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">It should take 5 to 10 minutes to sign up.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      You’ll need to wait for an email confirming you have registered.
