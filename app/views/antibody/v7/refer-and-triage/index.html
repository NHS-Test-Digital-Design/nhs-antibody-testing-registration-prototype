    <p class="govuk-body">An antibody test is a blood test to check if you've had coronavirus (COVID-19) before.<br><br>
    You can check if you're eligible to get a test kit.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
        <p class="govuk-body">It's different from the test to check if you have coronavirus now.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the antibody test kit</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The test is a 'fingerprick' blood test which checks for coronavirus antibodies.<br><br>
    The test kit is posted to you. It comes with everything you need. You take the test and post your sample back. Then you'll get your results.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
        <p class="govuk-body">This service is only for checking eligibility for an antibody test kit by post. You cannot use it to book a test at an NHS test site.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">What the antibody test can tell you</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">An antibody test can tell you if it's likely you've had coronavirus before.<br><br>
    An antibody test does not tell you:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>if you're protected from coronavirus</li>
      <li>if you can or cannot spread it to other people</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Why take the test</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">Taking the test helps the NHS and research scientists learn more about who's had the virus and how it has spread.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">If you've had the vaccine</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you've had the vaccine you are still able to check your eligibility to take an antibody test. This will help the NHS and research scientists to better understand how effective the vaccine is.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can apply for a home test kit</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The rules for who can apply for an antibody test depend on:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>if you're comfortable doing a fingerprick blood test</li>
      <li>if you have a mobile that can recieve text messages</li>
      <li>if you're 18 or over</li>
      <li>if you're part of a survey or study</li>
      <li>where you live</li>
      <li>your job</li>
    </ul>
