        <p class = "govuk-body">You can sign up for a free coronavirus (COVID-19) antibody test to find out if you've had the virus before.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">There is a different
            <a href="/antigen/v1/govuk/get-coronavirus-test">test to check if you currently have the virus.</a></p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7">About the test</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">The test checks for coronavirus antibodies.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">It's a 'fingerprick' blood test done at home. It's posted to you and comes with everything you need.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You take the test and post your sample to get your results. </p>

        <p class="govuk-body"><b>If the test shows you have coronavirus antibodies</b></p>


        <p class="govuk-body">Having coronavirus antibodies means it's likely you've had the virus before.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text" role="note" aria-label="Information">
            <p>Even if you have coronavirus antibodies, you might not be immune (protected) from catching the virus again or spreading it. </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-7">Eligibility</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The rules for getting a test depend on:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>where you live (England, Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland)</li>
            <li>your job</li>

            <li>you do any job in a care home</li>
            <li>you cannot get to an NHS test site to take the test</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Scotland</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">In Scotland, antibody testing is used to help understand levels of previous COVID-19 infection in the population.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you live in Scotland, you can get a test if you are:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">You may be invited to participate in testing again in the future. However, you should also be aware that signing up does not guarantee that you will receive a test, as we will be looking to select a representative sample.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Northern Ireland</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you live in Northern Ireland, you can sign up for a test as part of a study to understand the spread of coronavirus.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">After you've signed up</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to wait for a text message or email inviting you to order a test. You may get this invitation in a few days but it can take up to 3 months. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, not everyone who signs up will get a test.</p>

        <!--      <p class="govuk-body">Once you've received your invitation, you'll need to order your test. You'll get it within 5 days</p>-->
