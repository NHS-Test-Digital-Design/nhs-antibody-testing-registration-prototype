        <p class="govuk-body">You have told us that you believe your test is not void (sometimes called invalid).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The technology we use to read test results guarantees a high level of accurancy.
        For example, it is able to see faint lines on test strips which cannot be seen by the human eye.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This technology has read your result as a positive. To confirm whether
          you are infectious to others, please follow all the instructions below immediately. </p>

  <div>
   <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you need to do</h3>
   <p class="govuk-body">Because your result was read as void, you should take another test immediately.</p>
