<p>You need to tell your organisation you have tested positive.</p>
<p>You must take a different follow-up test today, or as soon as possible. Contact the organisation who gave you the lateral flow test for a different test.</p>
<p>This will confirm if you are infectious to others, start contact tracing and enable you to claim financial support if you are eligible.</p>
<p>You may get any of the main <a href=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/symptoms/>symptoms</a> of COVID-19 in the next few days. If you're worried, or your symptoms get worse, you should contact 111 (England and Scotland only) or speak to your GP. In an emergency dial 999.
