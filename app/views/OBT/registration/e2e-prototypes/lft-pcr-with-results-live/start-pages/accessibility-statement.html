        What we’re doing to improve accessibility
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        In early 2023 we commissioned a Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 accessibility audit of this website. The audit was carried out by <a href="https://diginclusion.com" target="_blank" class="govuk-link">Dig Inclusion</a> who are accessibility specialists. They looked at a selection of pages most likely to have accessibility concerns. The audit found some accessibility issues, which we have now fixed.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        We have also established accessibility processes, which we use as part of our ongoing work. These processes help us to design and develop accessible content when we make a change to any of our websites.
