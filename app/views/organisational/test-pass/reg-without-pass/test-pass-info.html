<p>Test registration codes will save you time when registering tests or reporting results through this service.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Overview</h2>
<p>A test registration code is a unique 8 digit number that is linked to an individual at your organisation. You can create test registration codes for both residents and staff.</p>
<p>When you create and enter a test registration code for someone, information such as their contact details, address and NHS number will be saved automatically. You will no longer have to enter these details every time you register a test or report a result on their behalf.</p>
<p>You will still need to enter the person’s first name, last name, date of birth and test details each time you register a test for them.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to create and use test registration codes</h2>
<p>If you are registering tests using the <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">spreadsheet</span>:</p>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Fill in the spreadsheet with each person’s details.</li>
  <li>Upload the spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Once you have checked the test details, you will be asked if you would like to create test registration codes for each person on your spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Select the people you would like to create test registration codes for.</li>
  <li>You will receive an email and text for each test registration code you create – these will go to the contact details you provided, but you can also send them to an additional email address if you wish.</li>
  <li>The next time you register a test for them, you can enter their test registration code in the spreadsheet to save time.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you are registering tests <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">one at a time</span>:</p>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Enter the person’s details.</li>
  <li>Once have you have completed their information, you will be asked if you would like to create a test registration code for that person.</li>
  <li>You will receive an email and text for each test registration code you create – these will go to the contact details you provided, but you can also send them to an additional email address if you wish.
  <li>The next time you register a test for them, you can enter their test registration code to save time.</li>
</ol>


<p><span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Keep a record of each test registration code you create</span> so that you can enter it the next time you use this service.</p>
