<p>You need to tell your organisation you have tested positive.</p>
<p>You must take a different follow-up test today, or as soon as possible. Contact the organisation who gave you the lateral flow test for a different test.</p>
<p>This will confirm if you are infectious to others, start contact tracing and enable you to claim financial support if you are eligible.</p>

    Until you get further advice, you and everyone you live with must self-isolate immediately for 10 days. This includes the day of your test and the next 10 full days. You can leave home for your follow-up test. Care home residents must self-isolate for 14 days.
