      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you enter England from an ‘amber’ country, you must quarantine for 10 days at a location of your choice.<br><br>
        During your quarantine, you must take a coronavirus test on day 2 and day 8 (where your day of arrival in the UK is day 0).<br><br>
        We’ll send the test kits to the address where you’ll stay in quarantine. You should receive them in time to take your day 2 test.
