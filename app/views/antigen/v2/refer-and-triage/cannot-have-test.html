        <p class="govuk-body">Sorry, it seems you're not eligible for a PCR test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are mainly for people who have coronavirus symptoms. Also, you cannot have the test if your symptoms started too long ago.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">There's a limited number of PCR tests available right now, which is why we cannot give them to everyone.</p>
      
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Do you want a 'no symptoms' test?</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          If you do not have symptoms, you can take a rapid lateral flow test to check if you’re infectious. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-covid-19-lateral-flow-test-site" class="govuk-link" target="blank">Find out if your area offers rapid lateral flow test sites</a>.<br><br>

                You could take a rapid lateral flow test to check if you’re infectious. However, you could still have the virus after a negative result - no test is 100% accurate.<br><br>
                Being vaccinated does not mean you cannot pass the virus on either.<br><br>
