        <p class="govuk-body">This service is only for people who need a PCR test. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are mainly for people who have symptoms. They're sent to a lab to be checked.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">PCR tests are restricted because there's a limited number available right now.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You will have arrived here because your answers told us you are not eligible for this type of test, or because your symptoms started too long ago.</p>

          If you do not have symptoms, you can take a rapid lateral flow test to check if you’re infectious. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-covid-19-lateral-flow-test-site" class="govuk-link" target="blank">Find out if your area offers rapid lateral flow test sites</a>.<br><br>
          Here’s some more advice if you’re in one of the following situations.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I’ve been notified by NHS Test and Trace that I’m a contact of someone who has tested positive for coronavirus but I do not have symptoms</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          You need to self-isolate immediately for 10 days.<br><br>
          If you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland, you may be asked by contact tracers to get a test. Otherwise, you do not need to get a test unless you go on to get symptoms.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="govuk-body">You need to self-isolate immediately for 10 days. This includes the day you were in contact with that person and the next 10 full days.</p>

        <p class='govuk-body'>You do not need a coronavirus test unless you go on to get symptoms.</p> -->

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I'm planning to visit someone at higher risk from coronavirus and want to make sure I do not have the virus</h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>
          You could take a rapid lateral flow test to check if you’re infectious. However, you could still have the virus after a negative result - no test is 100% accurate.<br><br>
          Being vaccinated does not mean you cannot pass the virus on either.<br><br>
          The best thing you can do is to:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>keep your distance from this person</li>
          <li>wash your hands regularly</li>
          <li>use a face covering</li>
        </ul>
        <p class='govuk-body'>If you are visiting someone in a care home, you may be offered a test by the care home.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">I need to get a test to travel to another country</h2>
        <p class='govuk-body'>If your travel company has asked you to get tested, and you do not have symptoms, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-private-providers-of-coronavirus-testing" target="blank" class="govuk-link">pay for a private test</a>.</p>
