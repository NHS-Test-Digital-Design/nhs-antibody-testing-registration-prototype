      <p class="govuk-body">People with <a href="#">coronavirus symptoms</a> can get a test, whether that's you or someone you live with. Some people without symptoms can also get a test.</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>high temperature</li>
          <li>new, continuous cough</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">This test can tell you if you have coronavirus at the time the swab sample is taken. The test to tell if youâ€™ve ever had coronavirus (antibody test) is not available yet.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What the test involves</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can usually choose to take the test at home or at a drive-through or walk-through test site.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The test involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud.</p>
